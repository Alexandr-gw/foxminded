                <h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
                <p>Cascading Stylesheets - or CSS - is the first technology you should start learning after HTML. While
                    HTML
                    is used to define the structure and semantics of vour content. CSS is
                    used to style it and lay it out. For example, you can use CSS to alter the font, color, size, and
                    spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other
                    decorative features.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2><a name="prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></h2>
                <p>You should learn the basics of HTML before attempting any CSS. We recommend that you work through our
                    Introduction to HTML module first.</p>
                <p>Once you understand the fundamentals of HTML, we recommend that you learn further HTML and CSS at the
                    same time, moving back and forth between the two topics. This
                    because HTML is far more interesting and much more fun to learn when you apply CSS, and you can't
                    really
                    learn CSS without knowing HTML</p>
                <p>Before starting this topic, you should also be familiar with using computers and using the web
                    passively
                    (i.e., just looking at it, consuming the content). You should have a basic
                    work environment set up as detailed in Installing basic software and understand how to create and
                    manage
                    files, as detailed in Dealing with files - both of which are parts of
                    Getting started with the web complete beginner's module.</p>
                <p>It is also recommended that you work through Getting started with the web before proceeding with this
                    topic, especially if you are completely new to web development.
                    However. much of what is covered in its CSS basics article is also covered in our CSS first steps
                    module, albeit in a lot more detall.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2><a name="modules">Modules</a></h2>
                <p>This topic contains the following modules, in a suggested order for working through them. You should
                    definitely start with the first one.</p>
                <b>CSS first steps</b>
                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages - for example, to alter the font,
                    color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or a
                    animations and other decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path
                    towards
                    CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks
                    like, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML</p>
                <b>CSS building blocks</b>
                <p>This module carries on where CSS first steps left off - now you've gained familiarity with the
                    language
                    and its syntax, and got some basic experience with using it, its time tc
                    dive a bit deeper. This module looks at the cascade and inheritance, all the selector types we have
                    available, units, sizing, styling backgrounds and borders, debugging, and le
                    more.
                    The aim here is to provide you with a toolkit for writing competent CSS and help you understand all
                    the
                    essential theory, before moving on to more specific disciplines like te
                    styling and CSS layout.</p>
                <b>Styling text</b>
                <p>With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for you to concentrate on is styling
                    text
                    - one of the most common things you'll do with CSS. Here we look :
                    text styling fundamentals, including setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop
                    shadows and other text features. We round off the module by looking at apply
                    custom fonts to your page, and styling lists and links.</p>
                <b>CSS layout</b>
                <p>At this point we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style and
                    manipulate the boxes that your content sits inside. Now it's time to look at ho
                    to place your boxes in the right place in relation to the viewport, and one another. We have covered
                    the
                    necessary prerequisites so we can now dive deep into CSS layout,
                    looking at different display settings, modern layout tools like flexbox, CSS grid, and positioning,
                    and
                    some of the legacy techniques you might still want to know about.</p>

                <h2><a name="solvingProb">Solving common CSS problem</a></h2>
                <p>Use CSS to solve common problems provides links to sections of content explaining how to use CSS to
                    solve
                    very common problems when creating a web page.</p>
                <p>From the beginning, you'll primarily apply colors to HTML elements and their backgrounds; change the
                    size, shape, and position of elements; and add and define borders on
                    elements. But there's not much you can't do once you have a solid understanding of even the basics
                    of
                    CSS. One of the best things about learning CSS is that once you know th
                    fundamentals, usually you have a pretty good feel for what can and can't be done, even if you don't
                    actually know how to do it yet!</p>

                <p>The following live example shows a biography, which has been styled using CSS. The CSS properties
                    that I
                    have used are as follows - each one links to its property page on MDI

            </section>
            <section>
                <h2><a name="addCss">Adding CSS</a></h2>
                <p>The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that we have some CSS rules we want
                    it to
                    use. There are three different ways to apply CSS to an HTML docume
                    that you'll commonly come across, however, for now, we will look at the most usual and useful way of
                    doing so - linking CSS from the head of your document.</p>
                <p> Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it as <code>styles.css</code>. The
                    <code>.css</code> extension
                    shows that this is a CSS file.
                </p>
                <p>To link <code>styles.css</code> to <code>index.html</code> add the following line somewhere inside
                    the <code>&lthead&gt</code> of the HTML document:
                </p>
                <p><kbd>&ltlink rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt</kbd></p>
                <p>This <code>&ltlink&gt</code> element tells the browser that we have a stylesheet, using the
                    <code>rel</code> attribute, and the
                    location of that stylesheet as the value of the <code>href</code> attribute.

                <h2><a name="background-attachment">background-attachment</a></h2>
                <p>The background-attachment CSS property sets whether a background image's position is fixed within the
                    viewport, or scrolls with its containing block.</p>

            </section>
            <section>
                <h2><a name="background-origin">background-origin</a></h2>
                <p>The background-origin CSS property sets the background's origin: from the border start, inside the
                    border, or inside the padding.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2><a name="background-repeat">background-repeat</a></h2>
                <p>The background-repeat CSS property sets how background images are repeated. A background image can be
                    repeated along the horizontal and vertical axes, or not repeated at all.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2><a name="display">display</a></h2>
                <p>The display CSS property sets whether an element is treated as a block or inline element and the
                    layout used for its children, such as flow layout, grid or flex.

                    Formally, the display property sets an element's inner and outer display types. The outer type sets
                    an element's participation in flow layout; the inner type sets the layout of children. Some values
                    of display are fully defined in their own individual specifications; for example the detail of what
                    happens when display: flex is declared is defined in the CSS Flexible Box Model specification.</p>

            <section>
                <h2><a name="flex-flow">flex-flow</a></h2>
                <p>The flex-flow CSS shorthand property specifies the direction of a flex container, as well as its
                    wrapping behavior.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2><a name="flex-shrink">flex-shrink</a></h2>
                <p>The flex-shrink CSS property sets the flex shrink factor of a flex item. If the size of all flex
                    items is larger than the flex container, items shrink to fit according to flex-shrink.

                    In use, flex-shrink is used alongside the other flex properties flex-grow and flex-basis, and
                    normally defined using the flex shorthand.</p>

                <p>The <code>grid</code> CSS property is a shorthand property that
                    sets all of the explicit and implicit grid properties
                    in a single declaration.</p>

                <p> Using grid you specify one axis using
                    grid-template-rows or grid-template-columns,
                    you then specify how content should auto-repeat
                    in the other axis using the implicit grid properties:
                    grid-auto-rows, grid-auto-columns, and grid-auto-flow.</p>

            <section>
                <h2><a name="grid-row">grid-row</a></h2>
                <p>The <code>grid-row</code> CSS shorthand property specifies a grid item's size and
                    location within a grid row by contributing a line, a span, or nothing
                    (automatic) to its grid placement, thereby specifying the inline-start
                    and inline-end edge of its grid area.</p>
